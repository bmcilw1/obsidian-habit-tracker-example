Welcome to an example [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault for habit tracking!

## Objective

This is not meant to be a full introduction into the power of Obsidian as a Second Brain. 

Instead, it serves as a simple example of how to combine a habit system with a personal journal/diary in Obsidan.

```tracker
searchType: dvField
searchTarget: mood
datasetName: Mood
folder: Calendar
line:
    title: "Mood"
    yAxisLabel: Mood
    lineColor: "#d65d0e"
    yAxisTickInterval: 1
    yAxisTickLabelFormat: i
    yMin: 0
```
