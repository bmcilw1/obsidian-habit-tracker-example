## Background

Welcome to the journal section of this example!

You can see example journal entries in the `Calendar` folder. Each title is the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Using this format helps the entries be sorted correctly.

## Habits

We are tracking our progress on our habits at the top of each entry. For example...

![[2023-03-30]]

- Out meditation and workout habits we are tracking with `1` if we did the habit and `0` if we did not
- We are tracking our mood on a `1-5` scale
- Our personal journal/diary for the day is located directly below where we record our habits

Our journal can be focused just on our habits, but for many people it works even better if it talks about your thoughts *generally* across all areas of your life that day!

## Next Steps

Look at the left sidebar and see the icon that looks like a calendar. 

1. Click it and fill out an entry for today
