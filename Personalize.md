## Review

Well done! We've seen examples of how we can use Obsidian for all the following
1. Downloading and using the most basic features of Obsidan
2. Seeing a summary from the data of our habits in the [[Habit Dashboard]]
3. Creating a diary/journal to record if we've completed our habits day-by-day, in the [[+Calendar]]
4. Adding notes to our journal to help us remember how we felt and what happned each day, also in the [[+Calendar]]

## Activity

Now that we have some understanding of how this is set up, modify the kit to track your own habits.

1. Open the [[Daily Note Template]] and change the data entries at the top to use names that you wish to track.
2. Create a new note to record your journal progress for today and make sure the template loads as you wish it to.
3. Delete all the other example journal date files
4. Go to the [[Habit Dashboard]] and click the `</>` icon on each chart
	1. Update the `searchTarget` to use the names you created for your habit
	2. Give each option a `datasetName` for each `searchTarget`
	3. Update or remove the `startDate` and `endDate`
	4. Update the `annotation` to use an icon to represent each habit that makes sense to you
	5. See that your habit charts are displayed properly
5. Update the [[+Calendar]] note to instead explain to yourself your committment to keeping a habit journal each day and any notes you feel you need about how to do so
6. Try out your new habit system for the next several days!

## Next Steps

Obsidian is a powerful and vast tool. We've only shown the smallest amount of how it can be used! For now, it's recommended to focus first on recording your new habits and less on building a more complex system. This can come later, since journaling is now part of your new habits!
